Just a note that I wrote this answer 4 years ago and the code I am running is still running 100 % fine today.Still keeping up to date with the latest versions of node and still zero problems: Its just a simple shell script guys.Not part of a big global object full of JS libraries. I still stand behind my answer today.I will give another update in 4 more years.
